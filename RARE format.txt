Song pointer table
===================
The song pointer table can be found by looking for the following code:
    ld l, c
    ld h, $00
    add hl, hl
    add hl, hl
    add hl, hl
    ld bc, SongChanPtrs
    add hl, bc

Each 16-bit pointer refers to individual channels; four, when joined, make a complete song.
Donkey Kong Land uses a complex form of "bankswitching", with many of the songs' data being spread over multiple areas of the ROM rather than fitting everything in one bank, probably to make room for graphics and other data. Each song outside of the "main area" is loaded into work RAM offset $A000, and the pointers in the table refer to addresses in RAM. The GBS rip attempts to get around this by joining all the song data into a single bank and using commands to re-map the addresses, but these instructions do not work with GBS2GB, making the majority of the songs unplayable in conversion.
Donkey Kong Land 2 uses a similar, although less complex method: the driver and most of the game's song data is stored as part of one bank, but five songs are instead stored in part of the last bank of the ROM, and the data all gets loaded into offset $D000 of work RAM. Unlike DKL1, all additional songs get loaded into RAM at once. The pointer table refers to these additional songs in RAM.
With the exception of Conker's Pocket Tales and Croc, all GBC games use some form of bankswitching. For Mickey Mouse racing games and Perfect Dark, the pointer table is specified as three bytes per channel rather than two, with the first being the number of the bank in ROM the pointer refers to.

Sequence commands
===================
Each command is referenced from an "event table" in the sound driver which tells which RAM address to go to after a byte of the sequence is accessed. Originally, the driver only included 23 internal commands, plus note values; however, later on, more commands were added. Games released from then up to Donkey Kong Land each feature a differing set of commands, with the most drastic being Donkey Kong Land, featuring a table of extra pre-determined note values, three different macro areas, and a repeat command, with this and the bankswitching trick likely done in a scramble to fit all the game's content into a 4MB ROM. However, Killer Instinct and later games, with the exception of Croc (which was not developed by RARE, but strangely uses a version of their driver) all use the same, consistent set of commands.
Each command works as follows:

Other notes
===================
 - The first game to use this driver, Wizards & Warriors Chapter X: The Fortress of Fear, which is also notable for being possibly the first Game Boy game developed outside of Japan, uses a non-standard frequency table which causes the music to sound at a higher pitch than intended. In The Amazing Spider-Man and all later games, this was changed to a standard frequency table seen in many Game Boy games.
 - In all games, with the exception of the previously mentioned Wizards & Warriors game, the first song is an empty pointer, and sometimes the first several are empty. Sometimes there are other empty pointers in the data, possibly songs removed from the final game.
 - The sound data from the Japanese Game Boy Color version of Donkey Kong Land III (Donkey Kong GB: Dinky Kong & Dixie Kong) is identical to the original mono version, and its sound data is stored in the same bank.
